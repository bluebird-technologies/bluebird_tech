                        Aurora was initially built by another development company. They lacked
                        adaptability which resulted in an unmaintainable code base. We were
                        initially tasked only to finish the original MVP, but it soon became clear
                        that we had to re-write everything. The original project ran for more than
                        one year, and we rebuilt it in three months.
